# Foliage3D Legacy

> [!WARNING]
> This is a legacy version of the Foliage3D addon.
> It has since been rewritten in the brand new `GD++` language, targeting GDExtension.
> The new project is <https://github.com/caphindsight/Foliage3D>.

Procedural foliage for Godot, quickly, straight into yor project.
Foliage is fully interactive and supports anything that a normal Godot scene supports, including collisions.
Multimesh optimization comes out of the box.
LODs are manual, added by the artist.

This plugin is meant to be used with [Terrain3D](https://github.com/TokisanGames/Terrain3D) and will not work without it.

Written in the beautiful and concise GDScript language.
Even though it's interpreted, the code uses optimal data structures and is multithreaded out of the box, making it blazing fast in practice.

Feel free to use in your projects (distributed under MIT), but if you do, please consider pinging me and telling me about your use case.

## Usage

### Adding to the project

1.  Open Godot4, create a new project.
2.  Head to AssetLib and download Terrain3D (or alternatively download from [here](https://github.com/TokisanGames/Terrain3D))
3.  Copy the `assets/foliage_3d` folder into your project
4.  Head to Project Settings and enable `Terrain3D` and `Foliage3D`.
5.  Restart the engine.

### Preparing foliage assets

You'll be using a few custom resources:

1.  `FoliageMesh` --- holds a reference to mesh, together with a list of material overrides for each of the surface of the mesh.
2.  `FoliageLOD` --- describes a foliage asset rendered at some LOD. Contains a list of meshes and other optional parameters.
3.  `FoliageAsset` --- describes an asset that can be instanced by Foliage3D.
	1.  Levels of Detail --- here you can set different `FoliageLOD` objects. Also you need to map the quad tree LODs to foliage LODs using `qlod_to_flod`.
	2.  Interactive Scene --- low-lod (by default, only LOD-0) instances will be asynchronously replaced by an instanced scene. This is how you can achieve
		collisions and further interactivity.
	3.  Transform --- set rotation / scaling randomization here.
4.  `FoliageSpecies` --- essentially a FoliageAsset, but with some more meta information.
	Includes abundance (probability of finding this species at a random location) and grid randomization settings.
5.  `FoliageLayer` --- this describes a collection of species placed on a grid with configurable spacing.
	E.g. this can be "forest trees".
	A very important setting here is `terrain_texture_names`: foliage will only be generated on matching textures.

### Adding foliage to the level

Just create a top-level `Foliage3D` node, and in the settings give it:

1.  A reference to your `Terrain3D`.
2.  A reference to your observer `Node3D`: this is the origin object around which the LODs will expand.
3.  A list of foliage layers.

### How do I paint foliage?

You don't.

This plugin assumes foliage is procedurally generated on the painted terrain.
You can control the foliage by painting different textures on the terrain.
